    <td>Well today was my first lesson with doing python using codecademy and I thought it was great, the way I learnt today was by reading all the instructions and the dialog on every question/page I was on and this helped because it didn't only tell me what to do but it also gave me an idea of what I was doing. The strategies that were effective where using what I just said above by reading it but also trying to think things through before I asked Mr Keen or somebody’s around me for help so this was effective because I not only sorted out the problem I was having but it also made myself realise what was wrong and how I fixed the problem and this is better than asking people for help because instead of wondering how they sorted out the problem I know knew how to solve the problem.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>what limited my learning was when I did have a problem that I wanted to sort out but it just took to long and that limited my learning because that meant that it didn’t give me as much time as I wanted to code. The habits that I need to work on our not talking to my peers that much when I am stuck because last time I was trying to talk to the person sitting next to me but he just got annoyed because he just wanted to work when I wanted help and so I just asked mr keen and he helped me.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be confident in myself so that I can work out my own problems and not let others do it for me which doesn’t benefit my learning at all which means that I will never learn how to do it, another thing that i will change for next time is thinking about other things that might of caused the problem instead of just trying one thing. Now how I will improve my learning is by doing the things that I said above, now I know that’s a lazy answer so let me explain, so I will improve my learning by doing things myself, asking people for help if I really need it be confident in doing my own things reading the dialogue and the brief and following the instructions carefully. That is how I will improve my learning.</td>
