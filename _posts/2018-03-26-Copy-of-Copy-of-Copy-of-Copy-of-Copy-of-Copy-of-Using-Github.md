    <td>Well today me and my partner learned by working slowly and quietly which meant that we didn't get put off track or distracted because we were just working and we just wanted to get the work done and out of the way. The Strategy that was effective was doing what i just said above which was working hard and doing it quietly and effective which meant good work which we could be proud of. This also mean that we could save our work properly because we know that we haven't been doing properly and if we did then not that frequently but this lesson we managed to get it done and saved.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>what limited my learning was when we did a piece of work with the lights but we tried to copy all the work just in case we lost the code but accidentally we deleted it instead so we had to write all the code again and that limited mine and my partners learning. The habits that I need to work on is being to worried becuase sometimes when I get to worried I start trying to do things like copying the code but instead we deleted so that Is what happens when I get to worried. Which messes things up so that is something that I need to fix.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be less worried and less cautious of what we are doing and me and my partner will make save our work as we go or ward each step so we donâ€™t feel like we have to copy and paste our work because we have done something wrong. How I will improve my learning is by working hard and focused so no silly mistakes are made and by being less cautious and letting my partner decide what he wants to do with the code elsewell.</td>
