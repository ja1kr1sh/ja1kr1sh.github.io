    <td>Well today I learned by when reading the book let that there were little pieces of code next to the main code which we could add to the code we had just done to make our code better and more advanced which helped improve our results and taught us more about what different code could do and this was an effective Strategy because I had never taken notice of this before because I always thought that it was just a little example of how to lay it out or something because me and my partner had just always followed the main code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>what limited my learning was when we had finished this Piece of code my partner Krister thought it was over so he accidentally pressed the edit button and the code just got deleted and we tried to get it back but it was saying we couldn't and this was annoying because not only did we lose all the code that we had been working on it was also a really big piece of code and neither him or I wanted to retype it all up. But when that happened I was really annoyed with my partner because that just meant we had lost a whole piece of code and I knew he was upset but at the time I was just ignoring him trying to get the code back which we had been working on.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>So in the previous paragraph I explained that my friend Krister did something that we thought deleted the code but then I realised that we had saved it before so we went to open but it wouldn’t open so I tried one of the previous files that we saved and that wasn’t working either so then we tried all them and that is when me and my partner realised that we hadn’t saved any of our code properly so we had to restart so that means that me and my partner have to start all over again so that is what me and my partner will change for next time and we will improve our learning by checking at the end of the lessons to see if we have saved anything properly.</td>
