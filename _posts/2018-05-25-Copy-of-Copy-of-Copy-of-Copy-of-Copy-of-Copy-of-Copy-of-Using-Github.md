    <td>Well today was my third lesson with using python using codecademy and today I learnt by moving on to stage 3 which went more deep into the way python works and how computers translate, the things that we learnt in sect in 3 where translations output but as well as that we also learnt about how to use different languages using python. The strategies that where effective were working quickly and not getting distracted and the reason for this is because if I get distracted then I won't work as first and will mean that I won't be learning as much as I can in the lesson and also if I don’t work quickly and effectively then I won’t be able to finish the python coding course by the end of the term.</td>

    <td>what limited my learning was when I had a problem I just straight away asked mr keen about how to fix and the reason that this limited my learning was because that meant that I was not actually learning how to solve the problem and this meant that in the future If i get a problem I am not going to be able to solve it. The habits that I need to work on is not always trying to rush and I know I said earlier that I need to work quickly but if I ruch while I’m coding then the code won’t work and when it come to finding out what the problem is that isn’t making the code work, and it turns out to be that I accidentally spelt a word wrong because I was rushing then that will just be a big waste of time on my part.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What I will change for next time is not overthinking and you may ask what do I mean by that, and I mean when I am doing my coding and I see my partner a few steps or levels ahead of me and so I feel that I have to work faster to beat him and this means that I am overthinking it to much about beating him. How I will improve my learning is yes by working accurately but you also working quickly and this means that I work quickly but I don’t make stupid mistakes as I do that so then I don’t have to go back and waste time by fixing those silly mistakes. I will also not compare myself to my partner anymore and will just focus on what I am doing</td>
