    <td>Well today Mr ampha-Korsa wasn't in which meant we had to have Mr keen. But anyway today me and my partner learnt saving our work once we had done a stage of code which meant that if we lost it when we start writing code again it would still be there because we saved it. And the strategies that were effective where putting our memory sticks in the fuse box before we started so then we would’ve have to waste time like we have been doing for the past few weeks and this helped because it also meant that when we saved our code we saved it right onto our memory sticks instead of the fuse box.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>what limited my learning was when me and my partner had finished a piece of code we kept having to ask the pair next to us for help when saving because we still don’t know how to save and everytime they tell us we always forget so that’s what limited our learning. Now the habits I need to work is the saving thing which is definitely something me and my partner need to work on but another thing is making sure that me and my partner always get to type because sometimes we are so stuck in writing the code that we just forget to swap so that’s a habit me and partner need to work on because it is fairer and because Mr Ampha-Korsa said so.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time me and my partner will as said in the previous paragraph will share out the typing so that we both know the code and what to type so that not just one of us gets to learn about fuze but both of us. And how I’ll I improve my learning, I will improve my learning by reading the piece of code to my partner Krister instead of just putting it down and telling him to read it and this will not only help him but me else well so I know the code and understand what he is typing and make sure that he makes no mistakes in the code which may risk us losing it which none of us would want. So that is is would I would to do to improve my learning which is reading out the code to my partner Krister instead of making him read it.</td>
