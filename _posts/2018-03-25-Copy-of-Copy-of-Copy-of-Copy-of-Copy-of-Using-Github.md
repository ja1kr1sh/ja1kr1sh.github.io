    <td>Well today me and my partner learnt by working quickly and effectively because at the start of the lesson we were at the beginning of project 1 round up but by the end we were on to stage 4 where we used the electrical component kit which is where we get to use the lights and control them for example we can code them to flash, turn on, turn off, and flicker. So me and my partner we're really proud of that. The strategies that were effective where of course working quickly and swapping effectively which meant we both got to do something and none of us got bored by doing just one thing but this way we were always on the ball and ready to move on.</td>

    <td>what limited my learning was when we first got our fuse box and the other things and when we put it together the monitor said that the hdmi had no source so me and my partner thought that the power cable was the problem so we went and changed the power cable but it still didn't work so we tried everything else but it just was not working but then we realised that we hadn’t changed the fuse box and it turns out that the fuse box was the problem so that really limited on learning because it meant that we wasted 10 minutes on something that could of been done in two minutes. The habit that I need to work on is being more self aware because with the situation I just talked about the fuse box was right in front of us which means that I wasn’t being self-aware but the next habit I need to work on is letting my partner run the code   the reason for this is because when ever we test out the code I always want to do it but then my partner doesn’t say anything I think that he doesn’t want to do it but later on when we are writing another piece of code he says Jai I wanted to go which means that that’s a habit I need to work on which is asking him what he wants to do elsewell.</td>

    <td>Next time me and my partner will as of course of the previous paragraph will listen to what my partner wants to do is well so then we both get a say in how we can make our code better and another thing I would change for next time is when typing look at the booklet eslewell so I don’t make any mistakes when typing which could hold us back. The way I will improve my learning is by reading the code as well book so then I can understand what to do if I ever need to type again I don’t need to keep reading the booklet right in front of me I can sort of remember it even though I won’t need to The way I will improve my learning is by reading the code is well so then I can understand what to do if I ever need to type it again I don’t need to keep reading the booklet right in front of me I can sort of remember it even though I will still need the booklet I worst have to put it right I front of my face face but this will also hopefully help with my IT skills in the future.</td>
