    <td>Well today I learnt by getting shown how to save pieces of code on to mine and my partners pen drives because just last week we realised that we had not saved any of our code from since when we started IT so we had to restart and now we know how to save code. So this was the Strategy that was effective because it meant that we now have all our code saved so that that we will not have to go back and type all the code again. Another strategy that was effective was when my friend Krister was reading out the code or vice versa he would read it out for me and then let me read so i know roughly what i am writing i am just a bit more aware because i have actually seen the code.</td>

    <td>what limited my learning was when before me and Krister had learnt to save a piece of code last lesson me and Krister where doing this code which was part of roundup and we had typed it all out and we "saved it“ at least we thought we had because when we went to open it from our pen drives it wasn't there then we realised we hadn‘t saved it so we wrote out the code again and it didn‘t save so we basically wrote out the code like 5 times and it didn't save so we did that and then it was the end of the lesson so we spent an hour trying to save one piece of code. So that is the habit me and my partner need to work on which is checking our code is saved before we move on to anything else.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>So for next time me and my partner will change by checking that our piece of code is saved before moving onto our next piece of code so that we when we come to opening that piece of code we don‘t have to come back and rewrite it all again which would just be a total waste of time for both me and my partner Krister. So what i have basically just said up there is how me and my partner are going to improve our learning and how we are going to be more efficient but another way that we could improve our learning is by being more efficient with our typing because me and my partner Krister take so long to type so maybe we should just improve our learning else well by doing that.</td>
