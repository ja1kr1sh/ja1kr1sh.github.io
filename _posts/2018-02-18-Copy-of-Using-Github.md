    <td>Well today I learned by asking my partner for help and the reason for that is because I had a music lesson which took up half of my lesson and when I got back everyone else had already started so when I got back, and sat down I didn't know what we were doing so I asked my partner and he filled me in and told me what we had to do what I had to save on my pen drive and what we had to do next and this helped because It got me feeling like I had been in the lesson the whole time which just helped. But the Strategie that was effective was working quickly, because while I was gone my partner had to do everything himself which obviously put him behind a little bit so when I got back and he had filled mein we got straight to it o arguing, no frustration and just wanted to get the job done and I am happy to say we did.</td>

    <td>what limited my learning was saving the work because obviously while I was gone my partner had saved all the work he had done onto his pen drive but when I got there I hadn’t done any of that, so me and my partner had to go back all through the work and save everything onto my pen drive and this wasted about 10 minutes which was really annoying. The habits I need to work on our not rushing  and this is because when I got back from my music lesson I just wanted to rush and get it done and as well as we got it done we did make quite a few spelling mistakes and missing spaces and things like that so the I just need to be a bit more pacing so me and my partner can be efficient and not keep going back through our code to change somethings we might have done wrong.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time me and my partner will try and do the more advanced things in our code like adding colour and things like that to make the outcome of our code look better because me and partner didn’t get to do that it this lesson because of course I was away and we were trying to rush to get everything done on time. I will improve my learning by asking my partner if there is anything else he would want to add to the code instead of just going by what I want because  he might have better ideas more creative way to do things to make our work look better and he might also add things that I don’t know about which would help because then as well as our work being better I would be learning something new else well.</td>
