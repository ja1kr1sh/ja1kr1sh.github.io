    <td>Well today I learned by or me and my partner learned by not talking to the groups around us which meant that me and my partner got more work done and we were able to get further in our learning which was really helpful because there's a lot of code in some states and not talking about it to other people just really helps get you further and so that you can see more code in action because we have been efficient. The strategies that were effective for me and partner were not swapping the book every ten minutes it was swapping every time we finished a section of code  because let's say my partner krister was doing section the first code on 1.3 when he has done I would do the second price of code which works really well with us and which also means we bot get more time working with the keyboard and reading out the manual.en </td>

  <tr>
    <td>what limited my learning was when we had finished a piece of code that we have been working on me and partner will always watch what we have created for about five minutes just being amused and not that this is a bad thing brand amused by your it is that we waste time and this means we don't get to do that much code as we would like to have in the lessons so this is something that definitely limited my learning. The habits I need to work on our when ever I write a line of code always check that there are no mistakes and I need to work on this because I make a few mistakes and I will usually never notice until I have finished the piece of code I have written which is quite time consuming so I think just to check after every line will be a bit more efficient.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will help my partner krister more than just when he asks me for help me getting really annoyed because we have been doing this this for five minutes instead I will just explain so he is up to speed and there is. O lagging behind so we both know what to do and home especially because when he types he needs to know what to do instead of know that we have been doing this for five minutes and you still don't get it. I will improve my learning by reading out of the manual slower for my partner and you may think how does this improve my learning and that is so we have the code properly typed out because I have read it out slowly to my partner so he has got everything written down write which means that me and my partner can save onto our memory sticks knowing that is all done properly and the same goes for my partner when he is reading it to me.</td>
