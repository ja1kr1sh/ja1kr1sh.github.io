    <td>In today's lesson we got into our pairs and we started doing work on our fuze boxes to start one person was reading out of the fuse box guide while the other did the coding and from there we just kept on switching and every ten minutes Mr Ampha-Korsa would say switch which meant that the the person who was coding would read and the person who was reading would code and this worked well because it meant that everyone got to have a go. The strategies that were effective where that both of us got to use the manual because let’s say one person said something but when the next person read they realised that the person before them said something incorrectly another thing that worked well was communicating with other pairs and now this meant that if we were stuck the pair next to us could help us so that we got to do everything them and the other pairs in the room where doing.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that we had to start according about 10-15 minutes Later than everyone else because the power plug for our fuse box wasn’t working but we thought it was the fuse box so we kept changing fuse box but by the time we realised it was the power cable everyone else had already started. So the habit I need to work on is don’t always think that the most obvious thing is the answer because sometimes you have to look a little deeper.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>That me and my partner think about the harder things rather than the easier things so we don’t miss out on any of our learning time and that me and my partner actually save our work we did in the lesson on our pen drives instead of not saving them. And I will improve my learning by asking Mr Ampher-Korsa for help when we’re stuck and we don’t what to and so that we are not wasting any of our lesson time.</td>
