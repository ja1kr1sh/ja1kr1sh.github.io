    <td>In today's lesson me and my partner and my partner were abit behind because last week we did not get to save our work onto our pen drives because we couldn’t figure out how so when everybody else got there fuze box they were already on tasks 1.3 and above where as me and my partner had to start from task 1.1 and the way me and my friend learnt from this is that we decided to stop coding about 2-5 minutes before everyone else so that gave us time to save our work on our own drives and the strategies that where affected was when me and my friend where behind we decided to just put our heads down and have no arguments or some minor setbacks otherwise we would just be more behind.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that my partner kept on stressing out that we wouldn’t get it done on time and this limited my learning because instead of writing the code I had to tell him it was ok and we would get it done if we just kept on focusing. The habit I need to work on is not rushing because if I rush I could type in the wrong price of code and the we would have to waste time by going and fixing it so that is something I need to work on the the weeks ahead.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>That me and my partner think about the harder things rather than the easier things so we don’t miss out on any of our learning time and that me and my partner actually save our work we did in the lesson on our pen drives instead of not saving them. And I will improve my learning by asking Mr Ampher-Korsa for help when we’re stuck and we don’t what to and so that we are not wasting any of our lesson time.</td>
