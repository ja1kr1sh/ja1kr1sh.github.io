    <td>In today's lesson me and my partner and my partner were abit behind because last week we did not get to save our work onto our pen drives because we couldn’t figure out how so when everybody else got there fuze box they were already on tasks 1.3 and above where as me and my partner had to start from task 1.1 and the way me and my friend learnt from this is that we decided to stop coding about 2-5 minutes before everyone else so that gave us time to save our work on our own drives and the strategies that where affected was when me and my friend where behind we decided to just put our heads down and have no arguments or some minor setbacks otherwise we would just be more behind.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that my partner kept on stressing out that we wouldn’t get it done on time and this limited my learning because instead of writing the code I had to tell him it was ok and we would get it done if we just kept on focusing. The habit I need to work on is not rushing because if I rush I could type in the wrong price of code and the we would have to waste time by going and fixing it so that is something I need to work on the the weeks ahead.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>what I will change for next week is asking the people around me and my partner for help so that instead of doing everything on by ourselves we have people who have already done it giving us advice on what we could do to perhaps make something we did better. And I will improve by listening to what my partner says because I could think that whatever I say is right but then when he tells me what he thinks I will think he is wrong but sometimes as we get further through whet we are doing we will realise that he was right and I was wrong and then this sets us brackets quit abit because then we have to go and fix rhe</td>
